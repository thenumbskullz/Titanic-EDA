# 🚢 Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle to understand the factors that affected passenger survival during the disaster.

The analysis identifies the influence of gender, passenger class, age distribution, and fare on survival outcomes.

## 📊 Steps Covered in EDA
✔ Loading and inspecting the dataset  
✔ Handling missing values  
✔ Statistical summary  
✔ Data visualizations  
✔ Correlation heatmap  
✔ Final insights and conclusions

## 🔍 Key Insights
| Factor | Effect on Survival |
|--------|--------------------|
| Gender | Females survived more than males |
| Passenger Class | 1st class survived the most, 3rd class the least |
| Age | Children had higher survival chances |
| Fare | Higher fare → higher survival probability |
